### Education:

##### **BEngSci (Digital Arts)**, The University of the Witwatersrand, 2017 - 2019

This qualification enabled me to develop problem solving skills while introducing me to a multitude of professional software practices. The focus of this program is the development of digital and analogue games, which highlights concepts such as user experience design and the importance of efficient robust code. 

I completed this degree with a final year average of 70%.

Projects that stood out for me during this course included:

- The final exam for a third-year course about using the world wide web as a creative medium. The final exam was to design and build an interactive experience through a website. I took this opportunity to challenge myself and decided to create the site in PHP, a language I had no experience with. The project can be found on my GitHub page, or through the following link: <https://github.com/keatondejager/WSOA3000_FinalExam> 

- I was a part of a team of students that built a vertical slice of narrative driven game to be presented in an exhibition as part of the final exam for the game design subject in third year. This project taught me important aspects of working on a more professional product over the course of a few months as a part of a team of individuals all handling different aspects of the project.

##### BScHons (Computer Science), The University of the Witwatersrand, 2020 (Current studies)

This program provided me with the opportunity to experience a wider range of skills that are related to the world of computer science. The subjects I have specialized in, include computer vision, machine learning, high performance computing, digital image processing, robotics and human computer interaction.

### Work Experience

##### Bartender / Barista, Jerry's Burger Craft and Shine, Jan 2018 - May 2018

Part time work during the first half of my second year at Wits. The restaurant unfortunately closed at the end of 2018. 

Attributes required to succeed at this role include: Time management, customer service, teamwork, multi-tasking, consistent detail orientation and reliability.

##### Tutoring, The University of the Witwatersrand, 2020

As part of the requirements for my post merit award bursary, I partook in tutoring of undergraduates throughout my honours year. This involved in person assistance with laboratory assignments and tutorials, until the pandemic made this impossible. At which point I performed these duties through email correspondence. I was also selected to oversee the laboratories which added the responsibility of granting extensions, and fixing problems with the online marking tool.

### Hobbies and Interests

My passion is to make engaging and immersive digital experiences, this is primarily through video games but is not limited to that medium.

In my spare time I run a custom Dungeons & Dragons campaign for a few of my friends. This involves creating interactive and engaging story lines, as well as customizing other game features which involves a lot of game balancing. This has also provided me with opportunities to build simple web-applications to assist in the story telling, by exposing portions of the narrative that are usually exclusively verbal, to the players in a tangible, more immersive fashion.  

I also draw / illustrate using digital tablet, pencil and ink. The majority of my artwork is inspired by my love for comic books and movies. 

I enjoy cooking and have an interest in film making (this is due to my belief in the importance of principles of film and their role in story telling in digital games)

I have an appreciation for language (both programming and verbal) and as such I am teaching myself Russian and French.  I am always eager to try out a new programming language as they evolve or become relevant to the project involved.
